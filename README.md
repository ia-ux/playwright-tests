# End to end tests for Archive.org using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)

## (Optional) BrowserStack Local Setup

## Running tests locally

There are two options: Docker and installing `playwright` and its dependencies in your local environment. Docker is likely easiest, as some dependencies seem to assume one has Focal-era libraries.

First, create a `.env` file by copying the contents from `.env.sample` and add the respective values you want to use for testing. This is required to run tests with loggedIn flows.

### Docker setup

By using Docker all the system dependencies should be installed (e.g. the non-npm dependencies, which still must be installed with `npm i`). It also makes it easy to run with `--headed` to see the tests run in the browser, though this may require Linux.

Note: you may need to update the `playwright` image version.

Run in Docker without the ability to use `--headed`:

```bash
$ npm i
$ docker run -it --rm \
  -w /work \
  -v $PWD:/work \
  mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.51.1-jammy /bin/bash
```

Run in Docker with the ability to use `--headed` (when using Docker, this likely this only works on Linux):

```bash
$ npm i
$ xhost +local:docker  # read about the security implications of xhost, including xhost+ if this doesn't work.
$ docker run -it --rm \
  -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
  -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
  -w /work \
  -v $PWD:/work \
  mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.51.1-jammy /bin/bash
```

### Local Setup (NPM option)

- Install dependencies:

  ```bash
  npm i
  ```

- Install Playwright browser libs:

  ```bash
  npx playwright install
  ```

## Quick start for running tests

If using Docker, run these commands in the shell started with `docker run`; if not, simply run them in your local shell.

- Run all tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

It's also possible to run specific tests, as the examples below show, and the next section covers in more detail.

- Run a specific test:

```bash
run test -- --title="Load theater: bookreader with lending bar"
```

- Run a specific test and escape quotes in the test name:

```bash
run test -- --title='Lending-Bar: auto-renew when user click \"Keep Reading\" button'
```

- Run tests in headed mode

```bash
run test -- --title="Basic display: Items display item details page" --headed
```

- Add a large amount of debugging output:

```bash
DEBUG=pw:browser*  run test -- --title="Basic display: Items display item details page" --headed
```

## Running Tests with Custom Parameters

- To run a custom script with flexible shell script arguments/parameters, follow these steps:

  1. **Command Structure:**

     - Ensure to use the `--` convention after the npm command to separate npm-specific arguments from those intended for the Node.js script
     - Without `--`, arguments may not pass correctly to the script

  2. **Flexibility in Argument Order:**
     - You can pass script arguments in any order to suit your needs for flexibility and customization

  ### Test Category (by Folder Structure)

  - Running tests from specific categories in the `tests` directory (except `tests/page-objects`):
  - If no category is specified, all tests will run by default.
  - Parameter: `--test`
  - Example usage:

    ```bash
    npm run test -- --test=about
    npm run test -- --test=books
    npm run test -- --test=donation
    npm run test -- --test=profile
    ```

  ### Test Execution Modes

  - **Headed Mode:**

    - Executes tests with a browser window visible on screen.
    - Parameter: `--headed`
    - Example usage:

      ```bash
      npm run test -- --test=about --headed
      npm run test -- --headed --test=about
      ```

  - **Debug Mode:**

    - Executes tests with Playwright Inspector for step-by-step debugging.
    - Parameter: `--debug`
    - Example usage:

      ```bash
      npm run test -- --test=about --debug
      npm run test -- --debug --test=books
      ```

  - **UI Mode:**

    - Executes tests with Playwright Inspector for UI-based debugging.
    - Parameter: `--ui`
    - Example usage:

      ```bash
      npm run test -- --test=about --ui
      ```

  - **Trace Viewer Mode:**

    - Records test runs for inclusion in the Playwright report.
    - Parameter: `--trace`
    - Example usage:

      ```bash
      npm run test -- --test=about --trace
      ```

  ### Test Execution by Browser

  - Running tests in specific browsers:
  - By default, tests run in all available browsers.
  - Parameter: `--browser`
  - Accepted parameters: `chromium`, `firefox`, `webkit`
  - Example usage:

    ```bash
    npm run test -- --test=about --browser=chromium
    npm run test -- --test=about --browser=firefox --debug
    npm run test -- --test=about --browser=webkit --headed
    ```

  ### Test Execution by Test Title

  - Running tests matching specific test case titles:
  - Searches for test titles within `.spec.ts` files.
  - Parameter: `--title`
  - Example usage:

    ```bash
    npm run test -- --title="TV has borrow button"
    npm run test -- --title="Canonical About page has correct title and text" --browser=chromium
    npm run test -- --title="Canonical About page has correct title and text" --debug
    ```

  ### Use helper function to generate custom test commands

  - To generate and execute custom test commands using the `generateCommand.js` script, follow these steps:

  - **Setup script configuration:**

    - Ensure you have `generateCommand.js` configured with the desired parameters (`test`, `browser`, `title`, `headed`, `trace`, `debug`, `ui`, `device`)
    - Adjust these parameters as needed for your specific testing scenarios

    Example configuration:

    ```javascript
    const sampleArgs = {
      test: 'books',
      browser: 'chromium', // Options: 'chromium', 'firefox', 'webkit'; default: all browsers
      title: '', // Specify a test case title within ""
      headed: false, // Set to true for headed mode
      trace: false, // Set to true to enable trace mode
      debug: false, // Set to true to enable debug mode
      ui: true, // Set to true to enable UI mode
      device: '', // Options: 'mobile', 'desktop'; default: desktop
    };
    ```

  - **Generating custom test command:**

    - Run the script to generate a command string that includes the specified parameters:

      ```bash
      npm run generate-command
      ```

    - This will output a generated command that can be used to execute specific tests based on your configuration:

      ```bash
      âžœ npm run generate:command

      > iaux-e2e-playwright-tests@1.0.0 generate:command
      > node scripts/generateCommand.js

      Generated command: npm run test -- --test=books --browser=chromium --ui
      ```

    - Copy the generated command and execute it in your terminal to run tests with the specified configurations

## Running tests using VSCode Playwright plugin

- install [VSCode Playwright plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-playwright.playwright) to run specific tests using VSCode

## Running specific test spec by file

- Command format: `npx playwright test <test-file-path>`

- Sample (headless):

  ```bash
  npx playwright test tests/search/search-layout.spec.ts
  ```

- Sample (headed):

  ```bash
  npx playwright test tests/search/search-layout.spec.ts --headed
  ```

## Running specific test spec by file in debug mode

- Command format: `npx playwright test <test-file-path> --debug`

- Sample:

  ```bash
  npx playwright test tests/search/search-layout.spec.ts --debug
  ```

## Running specific test case title

- Command format: `npx playwright test -g "<test-case-title>"`

- Sample:

  ```bash
  npx playwright test -g "TV has borrow button"
  ```

## View tests execution result

- Run command:

  ```bash
  npm run show:report
